# Template for React Vite setup with JavaScript

This is the setup I use for small React projects in JavaScript

## This template uses following setups

- Please remove the .git file by using command "rm -rf .git"
- Then use "git init" again
- Then "npm install" or "yarn install"
- Then "npm update" or "yarn upgrade"

### Using Vite for bundling

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) is a lightning-fast build tool for React projects.

### Using Tailwind-CSS for quick Styling

[Tailwind-CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) simplifies styling in your React application.

### Prepared React Testing Library and Jest

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) is a user-centric testing library that encourages testing your React components as users would interact with them.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) is a JavaScript testing framework that provides a simple and powerful toolset for testing JavaScript applications, including React components, with built-in test runners and assertions.

You can run tests by using ("npm run test" or "yarn test" depending on your package manager).

What you don't need you can remove and ofcourse install more dependencies which you might need for sure ðŸ˜Š
I hope this might inspire you to create your own template which you can keep on modifying and ofcourse create different variants.

Happy coding!
